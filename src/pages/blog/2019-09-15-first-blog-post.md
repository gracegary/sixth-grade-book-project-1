Dear Diary,

		I can’t believe it. I killed Blade. The one person who made me feel happy. One moment I was having the night of my life with him. The next, I killed him, stabbed him hard. _The blood, his blank glassy eyes, his lifeless body._ The thought made me shudder. It was the only thing I could think about. I cried till there were no tears left in my eyes. _He deserved it_, I thought. I was avoiding everyone. My life was perfectly normal up until I met him, that’s when everything went wrong. All because of him.





	It all started one day at Leftys, a very popular high school fast food restaurant. It was famous for it’s delicious cheeseburgers. Me, Miranda and Julie were sitting at our normal booth. “ And get this, then the kid dropped his second box!” I told them. “ Wow. I’m dying to hear more.” Miranda said as she rolled her eyes. " Yeah, tell me more my hearts pounding." Julie said sarcastically.  “ Okay so the Cineplex isn't the most exciting job ever, I said. What about your day?" I asked Miranda. " Believe it or not this cheeseburger is the best part of my day," she answered. " Will another one of my Cineplex stories cheer you up?" I asked.
