  I'm walking in Heaven. I want Blade to stay with me forever. I never want him
  to leave. I knew it was True Love at first sight. Little did  I know that I
  would be his killer, and I would never forget it.

Dear Diary,

I can’t believe it. I killed Blade. The one person who made me feel happy. One moment I was having the night of my life with him. The next, I killed him, stabbed him hard. _The blood, his blank glassy eyes, his lifeless body._ The thought made me shudder. It was the only thing I could think about. I cried till there were no tears left in my eyes. _He deserved it_, I thought. I was avoiding everyone. My life was perfectly normal up until I met him, that’s when everything went wrong. _All because of him._

It all started one day at Leftys, a very popular high school fast food restaurant. It was famous for it’s delicious cheeseburgers. Me, Miranda and Julie were sitting at our normal booth. “ And get this, then the kid dropped his second box!” I told them. “ Wow. I’m dying to hear more.” Miranda said as she rolled her eyes. " Yeah, tell me more my hearts pounding." Julie said sarcastically.  “ Okay so the Cineplex isn't the most exciting job ever," I said. "What about your day?" I asked Miranda. " Believe it or not this cheeseburger is the best part of my day," she answered. " Will another one of my Cineplex stories cheer you up?" I asked. " Hey look," Miranda said ignoring my question. " That boy over there, he's staring at you."

  Sure enough, I looked over and there was a black haired boy my age staring at me. " He won't stop staring at you," Miranda said. He's hypnotized by your beauty," Julie joked. I decided to walk over there.       " Hey, where are you going?" Julie asked. I kept my eyes on him. Matter of fact I was so focused on him that I didn't see the girl walking out.

 "Ah!" I said as we both fell down, it was a head on collision. Once I got to my feet, I helped the girl up and realized it was Deena Fear. "Sorry about that," she squeaked. " Oh Caitlyn it's you!" She said surprisingly. I  felt a quick jolt of surprise, I didn't know she knew my name. Deena has short black hair and loves horror. She was wearing skull earrings and dark lipstick. She also had pale skin. " I like your bracelet." She said. To my surprise she reached out and grabbed it. " Does it have powers?" She asked. "Um no I don't think so," I said. _Was she making a joke? "_ Well goodbye!" She said as she walked by me. _Strange, I thought._ I looked up and the boy was still staring at me. I walked over there to him. "Why are you staring at me?" I asked him. _He's actually really cute._ " Because you have lettuce on your chin." I flicked the lettuce off my chin. "What's your name?" I asked. "Blade," He answered. I chuckled. " No really, my parents wanted me to be sharp." We chatted for a while. Then I realized it was a beautiful night outside. " Hey you wanna go for a walk?" I asked. " It's a gorgeous night outside, " I added.

The next thing I knew we were walking on the sidewalk chatting away. " Then he flew away to-" I paused.    " Hey Blade, see that party over there?" I asked. " Yeah what about it? He asked.  "Let's go to it, it'll be fun and it's so crowded no one will notice two more people." 

A few seconds later we were in the party and I had another crazy idea. " Blade, let's start kissing in the middle of everyone," I said. " It could be a way of thanking our hosts," I said. " Caitlyn, I like the way you think!" Blade said. We got in the middle of the living room and started kissing. We kissed for a while. We kissed until I heard a girl yell, " Hey! Who are you?"  " Um, great party!" I said. Me and Blade laughed and ran all the way to the stoplight.
