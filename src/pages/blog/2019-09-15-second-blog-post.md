 Dear Diary,

   I almost died today. Here's how it happened, I was just peacefully leaving my job from the Cineplex when someone grabbed my shoulders. " Give me your wallet," he said. " Or I'll kill you," he added. His hands were fastly tightening around my neck. I couldn't breath, luckily I was prepared for this kind of situation. I quickly turned myself at an angle towards him and knee'd him in the stomach. I knocked the breath out of him, jumped into my car and drove away. 

   "That one please," I said. "How old are you?' the man at the counter asked. "It''s for my dad," I lied. "Alright this one?" he asked. " Yes, that one," I  said. I grabbed the bag from him and payed him. "Thanks!" I told him.  

" You bought a knife!?" Miranda yelled. We were at our usual booth in Lefty's. " Hey Miranda why don't you yell it a little louder? I don't think the whole restaurant heard you," Julie scowled. " Luckily there were only a few people there and they were across the restaurant. " Yes but I will only use it when I need too," I whispered. Even though the other people were on the other side of the restaurant, I didn't want to take any chances.

Later the next day I found myself sitting at the dinner table nudging my food. I had a date with Blade later that night and I couldn't focus. So as soon as my parents said I could be excused I immediately grabbed my phone and launched onto my bed.  Then about fifteen minutes later I got a message from Blade. I looked at my phone and read the text," Can't come tonight." it said. I couldn't hide my disappointment. But then I remembered Miranda had invited me too come watch videos at her house. I threw on my coat, grabbed my car keys and pulled out of our driveway. I was two turns from Miranda's house when a red convertible caught my eye. I looked at the license plate and gasped, it was Blade's car. 

I turned off my headlights and followed him. I stayed a few blocks behind him so he wouldn't see me. After a few minutes he turned into the country club. He parked and I watched him open the car door on the other side of him.
