 Dear Diary,

   I almost died today. Here's how it happened, I was just peacefully leaving my job from the Cineplex when someone grabbed my shoulders. " Give me your wallet," he said. " Or I'll kill you," he added. His hands were fastly  tightening around my neck. I couldn't breath, luckily I was prepared for this kind of situation. I quickly turned myself at an angle towards him and knee'd him in the stomach. I knocked the breath out of him, jumped into my car and drove away. 

   "That one please," I said. "How old are you?' the man at the counter asked. "It''s for my dad," I lied. "Alright this one?" he asked. " Yes, that one," I  said. I grabbed the bag from him and payed him. "Thanks!" I told him.  

" You bought a knife!?" Miranda yelled. We were at our usual booth in Lefty's. " Hey Miranda why don't you yell it a little louder? I don't think the whole restaurant heard you," Julie scowled. " Luckily there were only a few people there and they were across the restaurant. " Yes but I will only use it when I need too," I whispered. Even though the other people were on the other side of the restaurant, I didn't want to take any chances.
